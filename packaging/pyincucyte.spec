"""PyInstaller recipe for the PyIncucyte desktop app.

Build to a local directory, never into this checkout — the repository lives
inside Dropbox and the build set would be synchronised:

    $B = "$env:TEMP\\pyincucyte-build"
    pyinstaller packaging/pyincucyte.spec --noconfirm --distpath $B\\dist --workpath $B\\build

One-folder, not one-file: a one-file build unpacks the whole bundle to a
temporary directory on every launch and trips antivirus heuristics.

Differences from the Circadian Workbench recipe this was copied from:

* **Tkinter is the interface, so it must not be excluded.** The window is
  ``pyincucyte.gui.app``; excluding ``tkinter`` here would freeze an app with no
  way to draw itself.
* **pythonnet is needed, but the assembly it loads is not bundled.**
  ``engine.encrypt_password`` does ``import clr`` and then
  ``clr.AddReference("Essen")`` against whatever Incucyte install the machine
  already has. The bridge ships; the vendor DLL is discovered at runtime and
  stays the user's.
* **No data files read by path.** Unlike the workbench there is no ``static/``
  tree and no Alembic directory, so ``datas`` stays empty.

Settings live under ``%APPDATA%\\PyIncucyte`` via ``engine.default_app_dir``,
which falls through to that when no repository-relative ``.tmp`` exists — so a
frozen build lands in the right place without a code change.
