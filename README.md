# PyIncucyte

Download images off an Incucyte live-cell imaging system — from a desktop app, a
command line, or a Python script. It replaces click-by-click downloading with a
tool that knows what it already has and fetches only what is new.

Three front ends, one engine:

| You want to | Use |
|---|---|
| Pick a plate and grab the images | the desktop app — `pyincucyte gui` |
| Script it, or run it on a schedule | the CLI — `pyincucyte download …` |
| Call it from an analysis pipeline | the API — `from pyincucyte import IncucyteClient` |

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A network route to the instrument (at Imperial the Incucyte is on the internal
  network only — it is not reachable from outside)
- Windows with the Incucyte desktop client installed, **for the login step only**.
  The password is hashed by the vendor's own .NET assembly before it leaves the
  machine, and only that hash is stored. Once a machine has logged in, the saved
  credentials work without it.

## Install

```bash
pip install PyIncucyte             # from PyPI
pip install -e .                   # from this checkout
```

Windows users can also install the desktop application from the GitHub release
page with `PyIncucyte-<version>-Setup.exe`; the portable ZIP is provided beside
it. The Python package, ZIP, and installer are built from one release commit
and checked for version parity.

One name throughout: the distribution, the import name and the command are all
`pyincucyte`. The desktop app is a module inside it, so `pyincucyte gui` and
`pyincucyte download ...` are the same program.

Installing does not replace `py-incucyte-gui`, the name this was published
under before 0.3. Uninstall that one if it is still on the machine:
`pip uninstall py-incucyte-gui`.

### Pointing it at your instrument

There is no address built in. An Incucyte sits on somebody's internal network,
and an address written into the source would be published with every release,
so you supply it. Any one of these is enough:

```bash
export PYINCUCYTE_HOST=incucyte.your-lab       # once per machine
pyincucyte --host incucyte.your-lab probe      # per command (--host is global)
pyincucyte --host incucyte.your-lab login --name "Lab Incucyte"
```

In the app, use **Sign in** to add an address and optional device name; the
header chooser then switches between saved devices. Each device keeps its own
login and token. In Python,
`IncucyteClient("incucyte.your-lab")`
or let it read the saved login. Without one you get `HostNotSetError` before
anything reaches the network, not a failed request.

## The desktop app

```bash
pyincucyte gui        # or: pyincucyte-gui, python -m pyincucyte.gui
```

![The PyIncucyte window: vessels, wells, export, summary and activity log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jay2owe/PyIncucyte/main/docs/figures/pyincucyte-app.png)

Sign in, pick a vessel, paint the wells you want, choose a layout, then choose
one clearly separate action: **Preview images**, inspect the **Preview
download**, **Download** once, keep the folder current with **Sync**, or create a
**Scheduled download**. Everything long-running happens on a worker thread, so
the window stays usable and **Cancel** in the status bar always works.

Worth knowing:

- **Preview images** (Ctrl+P, Ctrl+I, or double-click a vessel) puts the selected
  wells into their physical plate grid. Phase, Green, and Red are selected one
  at a time, and the Z-stack control scrolls through the image positions in the
  most recent scan without laying channels out as separate tiles.
- **Preview download** (Ctrl+E) counts exactly what would be downloaded and
  lists the filenames, without fetching a single image.
- **Sync** (Ctrl+W) remains open, checks for new scans at the chosen interval,
  and downloads them as they appear.
- **Scheduled download** asks Windows to run one synchronization at a chosen
  interval. It survives closing PyIncucyte and rebooting the computer.
- **View time course** (Ctrl+T) opens one image with a time slider, playback,
  well/channel selectors and contrast controls. It samples at most 100 frames
  initially and loads uncached positions only when they are requested.
- **Scanned only** keeps just the wells the instrument actually imaged in the
  most recent scan — wells with no data are shown dimmed on the plate.
- **Copy Python code** and **Copy CLI command** (Tools menu, and in the confirm
  dialog) turn the current settings into either a runnable `IncucyteClient`
  script or the equivalent `pyincucyte` command-line interface command.
- **Presets** (File menu) save the whole recipe as JSON. The same file works as
  `pyincucyte download --preset my-run.json` and as `ExportOptions.load(...)`.
- The plate picker takes click, drag-to-paint, shift-click for a block, and a
  click on a row letter or column number to flip a whole line.
- Light and dark themes follow Windows, and the **Dark mode** header option
  overrides the system choice.
- Settings, window size and per-vessel well selections are remembered. Settings
  saved by earlier versions are migrated on first run.

## The command line

```bash
pyincucyte probe                       # is the instrument reachable?
pyincucyte login                       # saves credentials for the active device
pyincucyte --host incucyte-2 login --name "Incucyte 2"
pyincucyte --host incucyte-2 vessels  # use that saved device explicitly
pyincucyte vessels                     # what is on the device
pyincucyte find Cry1                   # which plate is that, and when
pyincucyte preview -v 38 -w A1-B3      # look at the wells before fetching
pyincucyte preview -v 38 --unmix green:12%red   # try a ratio before using it
pyincucyte timeline -v 38 -w A1 -c phase        # scrub through the run lazily
pyincucyte protocol -v 38              # how the run was set up, drawn
pyincucyte protocol -v 38 -o run.svg   # ...as a figure
pyincucyte --json preview-probe -v 38            # prove the tile route read-only
pyincucyte plan -v 38 -o ./images --start-from first     # dry run

pyincucyte download -v 38 -o ./images --start-from first
pyincucyte download -v 38 -o ./images --wells D2-D5 --channels phase,green \
                    --layout time_stack
pyincucyte watch    -v 38 -o ./images -i 10 --start-from first
pyincucyte watch    -v 38 -o ./images -i 60 --start-from first --batch-after 7d
pyincucyte watch    -v 38 -o ./images --start-from first --batch-after 7d --once
pyincucyte schedule -v 38 -o D:\runs\plate38 --batch-after 7d --every 1h

pyincucyte download -v 38 -o ./images --calibrate --unmix device

pyincucyte status                      # what is the instrument doing?
pyincucyte scan-now -v 38 --yes        # scan this plate now (changes the device)
```

Useful anywhere: `--json` for machine-readable output, `--preset FILE` to load a
saved recipe, `--save-preset FILE` to write one, `--dry-run`, `--quiet`.

`pyincucyte manifest ./images` summarises what a folder already contains.

### Time windows

`--start-from` and `--end-at` both take a date, a date *and time*, or a relative
offset. Both ends are inclusive.

| Written as | Means |
|---|---|
| `first` | the experiment's own first scan, at its real time of day |
| `today` / `now` | midnight this morning / this instant |
| `2026-03-05` | start: 00:00 that day. End: the whole of that day |
| `2026-03-05 14:30` | exactly that minute (`T` instead of a space also works) |
| `-48h` (start only) | a rolling window: 48 hours before now |
| `+72h` (end only) | 72 hours after the *start* |
| `-50f` (start only) | the last 50 frames |
| `+100f` (end only) | the first 100 frames from the start |

So the first three days of an experiment that began at 14:30 is
`--start-from first --end-at +72h`, and it correctly excludes that morning's
scans. Time units are `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, and the sign is required so an
offset can never be mistaken for a date.

**Frame counts** measure the same window in scan times rather than clock time —
`-50f`, `+100 frames`, `-24 scans` all work. Use them when the *length of the
stack* is what matters, which is usually the case for a video: `--start-from
-100f` gives a 100-frame stack whatever the scan interval was, where `-48h`
gives however many frames happened to fall in two days.

A frame is one scan time, so the count is unaffected by how many wells or
channels you select — five frames of two channels is five timepoints and ten
files. Count from one end or the other, not both.

PyIncucyte walks the days backwards for `-50f` and stops as soon as it has
enough, so asking for the last 50 frames of a three-month run costs a couple of
metadata calls rather than ninety.

The instrument only lists scans one calendar day at a time, so PyIncucyte sweeps
whole days and then trims to your exact window.

### Layouts

`--layout` replaces the old `--hyperstack` / `--time-stack` flag pair, which
still works.

| Layout | Axes | One file per |
|---|---|---|
| `separate` (default) | `YX` | well, channel and scan time |
| `channel_stack` | `CYX` | well and scan time |
| `time_stack` | `TYX` | well and channel |
| `time_channel_stack` | `TCYX` | well |

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v`, `--vessel` | Vessel ID — repeat for several |
| `-o`, `--output` | Output folder |
| `-w`, `--wells` | Well filter (`A1`, `A1,B3`, `A1-D4`, `all`) |
| `--vessel-wells ID:WELLS` | Per-vessel well filter (`-f` is the old spelling) |
| `-c`, `--channels` | `phase`, `green`/`color1`, `red`/`color2`, `all` |
| `--layout` | See the table above |
| `-s`, `--start-from` | `first`, `today`, `now`, a date/time, `-48h`, or `-50f` |
| `--end-at` | `now` (default), a date/time, `+72h`, or `+100f` |
| `-d`, `--date` | Shorthand for a single day |
| `-t`, `--scan-time` | Only scan times containing this text |
| `--workers` | Parallel fetches (default 4) |
| `--calibrate` / `--no-calibrate` | Write fluorescence in calibrated units, 32-bit float |
| `--unmix` | `device`, or a term like `green:8%red` (also on `preview`) |
| `--background` | `device`, or a number of raw counts |
| `--state-scope` | `auto` (default), `folder`, `global`, `none` |
| `--cache` | `auto` (default), `always`, `never` — cache source payloads |
| `--no-append` | Rewrite every time stack whole, instead of extending it |
| `--no-manifest` | Skip writing the manifest and CSV index |
| `-i`, `--interval` | `watch` only: poll interval in minutes |
| `--batch-frames` | `watch` only: hold new frames until N are waiting |
| `--batch-after` | `watch` only: ...or until the oldest has waited `7d` / `12h` |
| `--once` | `watch` only: poll once and stop, for a scheduled task |

## The Python API

This is the part an automated pipeline should use.

### AI control

The public, read-only guide is available without contacting the instrument:

```python
from pyincucyte import context

print(context.read())
print(context.search("preview"))
```

Agents can discover and run the same headless actions through
`.claude/skills/pyincucyte/scripts/pyincucyte_runner.py` or the Codex bridge at
`.codex/skills/pyincucyte/scripts/pyincucyte_runner.py`. The portable copies
are `README_AI.md` and `pyincucyte_context.json`.

For a single pull or scheduled poll, the package-level helpers match PyLV200:

```python
import pyincucyte

result = pyincucyte.pull(38, out="./run-01", start_from="first")
result = pyincucyte.watch_once(38, out="./run-01", start_from="first")
```

Both use the saved login, close the connection when finished, and return a
`DownloadResult`. `watch_once` returns `None` while a requested batch is still
being held. Results, plans, vessels, scans, files, and progress events expose
`to_dict()` records whose values can be passed directly to `json.dumps`.

```python
from pyincucyte import IncucyteClient

with IncucyteClient.from_saved() as incucyte:
    plan = incucyte.plan(
        vessel=38, output="./run-01",
        wells="A1-D6", channels="phase,green",
        layout="time_channel_stack",
        start_from="first", end_at="+72h")     # the first three days

    print(plan.summary())
    # 1 vessel - 24 wells - 118 scan times - One ImageJ TCYX stack per well
    # 24 output files - 5,664 source images - ~15.8 GB

    result = incucyte.download(plan, progress=print)

for image in result.files:
    segment(image.path,
            well=image.well,            # "A1"
            channels=image.channels,     # ["Phase", "GFP"] in stack order
            axes=image.axes,             # "TCYX"
            timepoints=image.scan_times)
```

`incucyte.fetch(...)` plans and downloads in one call. `start_from` and `end_at`
also accept `date` and `datetime` objects directly, and `plan.window` reports the
`(start, end)` the plan actually used — it is recorded in the manifest too.

### Finding the right vessel, and looking at it

A vessel id is not a memorable thing, and the wrong one costs a whole download.
`find_scans` searches for the plate and `preview` shows you its wells.

```python
scans = incucyte.find_scans("Cry1", most_recent=1)   # newest scan of that plate
scans[0].preview(wells="A1-B3").show()               # a scrollable window

incucyte.find_scans(plate=24, channel="GFP")         # every 24-well GFP plate
incucyte.find_scans(vessel=38, most_recent=3)        # its last three scans
incucyte.find_scans(vessel=38, at="-48h")            # the scan nearest 48h ago
```

Each result is a `VesselScan`: the vessel, one scan time, and the wells,
channels and sites that scan actually holds — `.well_names`, `.elapsed`,
`.channel_summary`, `.summary()`, `.to_dict()`. Days are walked backwards from
the vessel's own last scan, and a scan is only returned once the device confirms
it contains that vessel, so `most_recent=1` means the newest *usable* scan and
usually costs one call.

`preview` takes a `VesselScan` (or a list of them, a `Vessel`, an id, a name, or
the same filters as `find_scans`) and returns a `PreviewSet`:

```python
preview = incucyte.preview(vessel=38, wells="A1-B3", channels="phase")
preview.show()                    # blocks in a script, returns in the GUI
preview.save("./thumbs")          # PNGs, one per tile
preview.summary()                 # "6 of 6 images - 6 wells - Phase"
for tile in preview:
    tile.well, tile.channel, tile.array      # "A1", "Cry1-GFP", uint8 2-D
```

Compatible Incucyte releases expose an undocumented image pyramid: like the
progressively smaller copies used by an online map, it lets the viewer request
a reduced tile instead of the full TIFF. PyIncucyte detects those routes per
session and falls back to the established full-TIFF export route when they are
missing or malformed. `max_images` (24 by default) still bounds the static wall.
The tiles are downsampled and contrast-stretched for recognition, never
measurement.

For a long run, use the lazy timeline instead of asking the static wall to show
every timepoint:

```python
timeline = incucyte.timeline(
    38, wells="A1-B3", channels="phase", output="./run-01",
    start_from="first", end_at="now")
timeline.show()

timeline.source.get_frame("A1", 0, 1, 1337)  # native reduced values on demand
timeline.close()
```

The first view uses at most 100 evenly spaced frames. A cache miss fetches that
frame and the window preloads a small neighbourhood. Native and rendered caches
have separate fixed bounds, so a 2,000-frame slider never retains 2,000 arrays
or Tk images. Existing timestamp-matched exported stacks and disposable
`.pyincucyte-preview/` frames are read before the device; the fallback reads a
bounded full TIFF, reduces it immediately, and releases the encoded payload.

### What the run is actually doing

The Incucyte software draws an experiment as nested boxes — a time loop around a
well loop around a chain of channel nodes — and locks the picture inside the
vendor software on the machine beside the instrument. Every fact in it is
already on the wire:

```python
print(incucyte.protocol(38))                    # the drawing, in the terminal
incucyte.protocol(38).save("protocol.svg")      # ...as a figure
```

```

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

It says three things the vendor's own graph does not. The requested cadence and
the **achieved** interval are both on the page and labelled as different facts —
enough wells at a long enough exposure overrun the schedule, and the derived
number is the one that is true. It says how far the run has got, and which wells
the last scan actually reached. And every value carries where it came from: the
vessel record, the scan payload, or the scan times.

`-o` writes the drawing. `.svg` costs no plotting stack at all — which matters
because the packaged desktop app excludes matplotlib outright; `.png` and `.pdf`
go through matplotlib (`pip install PyIncucyte[figure]`). `--dark` matches a
dark slide. Nothing here reads a pixel, and `--no-scan` skips sweeping the run's
whole lifetime as well.

In the app it is **Tools → Acquisition protocol** (Ctrl+R).

### Preprocessing

The instrument's own export wizard offers *As Displayed* (a picture, with
everything on screen baked in) and *As Stored* ("the raw data" — Sartorius is
explicit that "user-specified settings are not reflected in this type of
export"). PyIncucyte downloads the *As Stored* pixels, so nothing arrives
preprocessed.

What does arrive, in the scan metadata the planner already reads, are the
instrument's own coefficients — `Scale`/`Bias` per image, the `ImageMedian`
background it measured, and the `ColorUnmixes` percentages somebody set in the
Incucyte software. Three options turn those into the same corrections, without
retyping anything:

```python
incucyte.fetch(vessel=38, output="./run-01",
               calibrate=True,        # counts -> calibrated units, 32-bit float
               background="device",   # the level the instrument measured
               unmix="device")        # the vessel's own saved percentages
```

| Option | Values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `calibrate` | `True` / `False` | `(raw - Bias) / Scale`, written as 32-bit float in GCU/RCU |
| `background` | `"device"`, a number, `""` | subtracts a background level in raw counts |
| `unmix` | `"device"`, `"green:8%red"`, an `Unmixing`, `""` | subtracts a fraction of the other channel |

All three default to off, apply in the order **calibrate → background → unmix →
clip at zero**, and never touch Phase, which has no calibration. An explicit
unmix term reads `recipient:amount contributor`, optionally with `@2` to blur
the contributor first as the device's `BlurringSigma` does; several terms are
comma-separated.

#### Setting your own unmixing

`"device"` uses whatever somebody typed into the Incucyte software, which was
chosen to look right on screen — not necessarily what an analysis wants. Read
it, change it, and check it before committing:

```python
mixing = incucyte.unmixing(38)      # an Unmixing: green:8%red
mixing["green"] = 0.12              # take more red out of green
mixing.set("red", "green", 0.02)    # and a little the other way
mixing.blur("green", sigma=2)       # blur the contributor first, as the device can

incucyte.preview(38, wells="A1", unmix=mixing).show()   # look at it
incucyte.fetch(vessel=38, output="./run-01", unmix=mixing)
```

`Unmixing` is a small mutable set of terms keyed by `(recipient, contributor)`:
`mixing["green"]` reads the ratio, `mixing["green"] = 0` removes the term,
`mixing.scaled(0.5)` halves everything at once, and `str(mixing)` is the spec
string a preset stores. `ExportOptions(unmix=...)` accepts the object, a spec
string, or a plain list of terms, and always stores the spec — so a recipe you
tuned in a notebook is the same recipe on the command line.

Previewing is how you tune it: unmixing and background removal visibly change
the thumbnails, so `pyincucyte preview -v 38 --unmix green:12%red` shows the
result of a ratio before an experiment is downloaded with it. Calibration is
invisible in a preview — it is a linear rescale and the contrast stretch undoes
it. `pyincucyte find` prints each vessel's saved unmixing in its own column.

Three things worth knowing:

- **Processed files are named for it** — `VID38_A1_2_00d00h00m_cal-unmix.tif`.
  That keeps raw and corrected pixels from ever sharing a filename, and it is
  what lets a second run with a different recipe resume properly instead of
  deciding it already has the file.
- **Unmixing reads the other channel**, so it costs an extra download per image
  when that channel was not selected. The payload cache is switched on
  automatically when unmixing to keep a time stack from re-fetching it per frame.
- **It is not guaranteed bit-identical to the Incucyte's own export.** Sartorius
  does not publish the order it applies these in, and the direction of `Scale`
  is inferred from the manual's worked example. Check one well against a
  "Green calibrated" export before trusting a whole experiment to it.

The recipe is recorded in `pyincucyte-manifest.json` (under `options`) and on
every file entry, so a later pipeline stage can always tell what it is reading.

### What you get back

![DownloadResult contains OutputFile records, each containing one channel record per plane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jay2owe/PyIncucyte/main/docs/figures/result-object.png)

Containment is the point: one file entry answers every question about the stack
it describes, so the next stage never has to join anything. PyLV200 writes the
same shape under the names `PullResult` / `channel_refs`.

`DownloadResult` carries `.files` (typed `OutputFile` records), `.paths`,
`.errors`, `.cancelled`, `.bytes_total`, `.duration_seconds` and `.summary()`.
Failures are collected, not raised — one unreadable well never aborts a plate.

Each `OutputFile` knows its vessel, well, row/column, site, channel display
names, device channel numbers, scan times, ImageJ axis order, elapsed-time label
and size.

### The manifest

Every download writes `pyincucyte-manifest.json` and `pyincucyte-index.csv` into
the output folder. **Read these instead of globbing the folder and re-parsing
filenames** — they already say which well, channel and timepoint every file is.
Watch mode merges into the same manifest, so it stays a complete index of the
folder however many polls filled it.

```python
import json, pandas as pd
manifest = json.load(open("run-01/pyincucyte-manifest.json"))
index = pd.read_csv("run-01/pyincucyte-index.csv")
```

Each file entry is written in the **shared handoff contract** the SCN analysis
pipeline uses, so one reader serves this package, PyLV200 and Auto-Organotypic alike:

| Field | What it saves you working out |
| --- | --- |
| `channels` | `{index, name, image_type, source}` per plane, `index` counting from **one** as ImageJ does. The index describes the written stack, not the vessel — a well that missed a channel would otherwise shift every name after the gap by one |
| `frames` | Timepoints the file holds *now* |
| `complete` | Whether it can still gain frames. A time stack is extended in place on every poll, so `frames` is true when read and stale a moment later. `null` means nobody can honestly say — which is **not** the same as `false` |
| `frames_expected` | How many it should hold once the run finishes, so a well the instrument skipped is visible as such rather than as a short recording |
| `blank_planes` | Planes allocated but not acquired — always 0 here, since nothing is written until every plane is downloaded and checked |
| `field` | `{"kind": "well", "name": "A1"}` — the cross-instrument spelling of what `well` says in this package's own terms |
| `interval_s` | `{"value": 1800, "source": "derived from this file's scan times"}` — the cadence, and where the number came from |
| `pixel_size_um` | `{"value": 2.824051, "source": "read from the vessel's ImageSize"}` — read off the instrument, not inferred from the objective |

`null` with a stated reason is deliberate: a plausible number nobody can trace is
worse than an honest gap. The CSV index carries the same values with the
provenance in its own `_source` column, and the channel names in place of the
records a spreadsheet column cannot hold.

Two contract fields are deliberately absent. `registered` and `valid_mask`
belong to whatever aligns the pixels — an instrument does not know whether its
output was later registered, and this one produces no valid-field mask at all.

On the Python side `OutputFile` uses the same names, with `channel_names` for
when you just want `["Phase", "GFP"]`.

### Watching, without blocking

```python
watcher = incucyte.watch(options, on_result=lambda r: analyse(r.paths))
...                                  # your pipeline carries on
watcher.stop(wait=30, flush=True)    # flush collects the tail and marks it done
```

`Watcher` also works as a context manager, and `run_forever()` blocks if that is
what you want.

### Starting the next step before the poll finishes

`on_result` fires once per poll with the whole result. A poll that collects 96
wells therefore delivers nothing until all 96 have landed. Pass `on_file`
instead — or as well — to be handed each file the moment it is written:

```python
incucyte.watch(options, on_file=lambda image: outline(image.path,
                                                      well=image.well))
```

It works the same way on `download()` and `fetch()`, and is handed the same
`OutputFile` that ends up in `result.files`. A callback that raises is logged and
does not stop the download.

Files a watcher writes mid-run are marked `complete: false`; the flush that ends
the run marks them `true`. Pass `complete=` to `download()` to state it yourself.

### Downloading in chunks instead of frame by frame

By default a frame is fetched the moment it appears. Set `batch_frames` and/or
`batch_after` and the watcher **holds** new frames instead, downloading only
once the chunk is worth fetching — so an experiment can be started on the Monday
and collected the following week in one pass:

```python
watcher = incucyte.watch(options, vessel=38, output="./run-01",
                         start_from="first", batch_after="7d", interval=60)
```

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `batch_frames=50` | Wait until 50 new frames are ready |
| `batch_after="7d"` | ...or until the oldest waiting frame is 7 days old |
| both | Whichever comes first — a fast run does not wait out the clock, and a stalled one still delivers what it has |
| neither (default) | Download on sight |

A **frame** is one moment on the time axis, not one file: 50 frames of a 24-well
plate in two channels is 2,400 images. `batch_after` takes `90m`, `12h`, `7d`,
`2w`, and its clock runs from the *waiting frame's own timestamp* — so pointing
a fresh watcher at a week-old experiment collects it immediately rather than
waiting another week, and restarting a watcher does not restart the wait.

While a chunk is held nothing is written and the resume ledger is untouched, so
the frames stay collectable however the watcher ends. To take a part-full chunk
— the tail of an experiment that will never reach its count:

```python
watcher.flush()                      # download what is waiting, right now
watcher.stop(flush=True)             # ...or on the way out
print(watcher.pending_frames, watcher.hold_description)
```

`on_hold=` is called with the watcher on each poll that finds work and decides
to wait. One caution: a poll re-checks the whole window whether or not the chunk
is due, so pair a long chunk with a lazy `interval` (an hour, not ten minutes).

### One poll, from a scheduled task

`--once` polls a single time and exits, so the schedule belongs to Windows
rather than to a resident process. Nothing is held between firings and nothing
needs to be: `batch_after` runs from each frame's own acquisition time and
`batch_frames` counts the instrument against the resume ledger, so the poll
after a reboot decides exactly what the poll before it would have decided.

`pyincucyte schedule` registers that task, and registers it so it keeps
running:

```bash
pyincucyte schedule -v 38 -o D:\runs\plate38 -s first --batch-after 7d --every 1h
```

Windows asks for this account's credential in its own prompt — it goes straight
to Windows, never through PyIncucyte — and the task then runs on a rebooted,
locked machine. `--at-logon` skips the question and waits for somebody to log
in instead. `--wake` wakes a sleeping computer for each check, `--list` shows
what is scheduled and how each one is doing, and `--remove <name>` deletes one.

Writing the `schtasks` line by hand is the thing to avoid, and not for
convenience. Measured on a real Windows 11 machine, a task created from the
plain flags comes back with five defaults that quietly stop it:

| Windows default | after the computer is turned off |
|---|---|
| `LogonType` = InteractiveToken | runs **only while that user is logged on** |
| `StartWhenAvailable` false | a firing missed while it was off is never caught up |
| `DisallowStartIfOnBatteries` true | never starts unplugged |
| `StopIfGoingOnBatteries` true | killed mid-download when the power goes |
| `WakeToRun` false | a sleeping computer sleeps through every check |

None of the five can be set through `schtasks` flags, so `schedule` registers
from a task definition and then reads all five back off the registered task.
Created is not the same as will run.

The exit code is the whole interface, and they are the three `pylv200` uses so
a task written for one instrument reads the same as one written for the other:

| code | meaning | what a task should do |
|------|---------|-----------------------|
| 0 | a chunk was due and was downloaded | run whatever comes next |
| 1 | nothing written — still holding, or nothing new | nothing |
| 2 | the instrument could not be reached, or the poll failed | look at it |

Run it hourly and a seven-day chunk fires once a week: 167 firings in 168 write
nothing and cost one metadata pass each. A bad argument exits 2, not 1, and so
does an unexpected crash — exit 1 means "nothing was due", which is a normal
poll, so it can never also mean "it broke".

Put the global `--json` option before the command for one strict JSON document
on standard output; progress stays on standard error. Success returns the same
`DownloadResult.to_dict()` shape as Python. Failures use
`{"ok": false, "error": {"type": "...", "message": "..."}, "command": "watch"}`.

```bash
pyincucyte --json watch -v 38 -o ./images --start-from first --once
```

### Talking back to the instrument

Everything above reads. Three calls write, and they are the only ones in the
package that change the Incucyte at all:

| | What it does | Reaches |
|---|---|---|
| `device_state()` | what the instrument is doing, how warm it is, when it next scans | read only |
| `begin_scan(vessel)` | asks for a scan of one plate, now | that plate |
| `save_unmix(vessel, spec)` | stores unmixing on a vessel, so the Incucyte's own software displays it | that plate |

Reading is free:

```python
state = incucyte.device_state()
print(state.summary())          # "Scanning, 42% done, ~1h 12m left"
if state.has_problem:           # disk full, hot board, RAID degraded...
    alert(state.activity)
```

```bash
pyincucyte status               # exits non-zero if the instrument reports a fault
pyincucyte status --json        # for a monitoring script
```

Writing is not. The instrument is shared, so a write says so in as many words
or it does not happen — there is no default that sends:

```python
incucyte.begin_scan(38)                     # ConfirmationRequiredError, sends nothing
incucyte.begin_scan(38, confirm=True)       # goes
```

```bash
pyincucyte scan-now -v 38 --yes
pyincucyte unmix -v 38                      # show what the vessel has
pyincucyte unmix -v 38 --set green:8%red --yes
```

In the app: **Tools → Device status**, **Scan selected vessel now**, **Save
unmixing to instrument**, each behind a dialog.

Both writes also refuse while the instrument reports a fault — starting a scan
into a full disk achieves nothing — unless you pass `--force` / `force=True`.

Two things worth knowing:

- **There is no stop.** The device API has no stop, pause or abort. Ending an
  experiment early means replacing the schedule for the *whole tray*, every
  vessel on it — someone else's plate included — so PyIncucyte does not do it.
- **`save_unmix` is never needed for downloading.** `fetch(..., unmix=...)`
  does that arithmetic here, on the pixels, touching nothing. Saving is only
  for changing what the Incucyte's own viewer shows other people.

None of this has run against the real instrument. The route and field names
come from the vendor client assemblies rather than from guesswork, but the
first `scan-now` at Imperial should be watched.

### Presets shared with the GUI

```python
from pyincucyte import ExportOptions

options = ExportOptions.load("nightly.json")     # saved from the GUI
result = incucyte.fetch(options.replace(output="./tonight"))
print(options.cli_command())                     # the equivalent CLI line
```

### Why watch mode stays cheap

A time stack has to contain every frame, so one new scan invalidates the whole
file. Done naively that means re-downloading and rewriting the entire
experiment on every poll, and it gets worse with every hour of the run. Two
things stop it.

![An ImageJ stack keeps its directory at the end, so new planes are written where it was and the four-byte header pointer is repointed last](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jay2owe/PyIncucyte/main/docs/figures/stack-append.png)

**New frames are added to the file, not rewritten into a new one.** An ImageJ
stack keeps its directory of frames *after* the pixel data — like a book with
its index at the back — so PyIncucyte writes the new frames on the end and
reprints the index, leaving the existing pixels exactly where they are. On a
144-frame stack of 1408×1040 images that is 2.9 MB written instead of 422 MB,
and unlike a rewrite the cost does not grow as the experiment does.

It happens only when the file on disk is provably the earlier part of the same
stack: the resume ledger has to say so, the frames already there have to be the
*first* of the ones being written, and the geometry, channels and processing
recipe all have to match. Any doubt at all — a widened time window that puts
new frames in front of old ones, a stack written by something else, a file that
will not open — and the whole file is written instead. `--no-append`
(`append_stacks=False`) forces that everywhere.

**Source payloads are cached.** `.pyincucyte-cache/` inside the output folder
keeps each image the first time it is fetched, so the rewrites that do happen
are a disk read rather than a fresh download, and only genuinely new frames
touch the instrument. It is on automatically for the time layouts.
`--cache always` / `--cache never` (or `cache_payloads=` in `ExportOptions`)
override that; deleting the folder only costs time. `result.cache.summary()`
reports the hit rate.

### Resume state

By default the ledger of what has already been fetched lives in the output
folder (`.pyincucyte-state.json`), so parallel experiments never collide and
moving a folder moves its history with it. `state_scope="global"` restores the
old shared file; `"none"` disables resume entirely.

### Errors

Everything derives from `IncucyteError`, so a pipeline can wrap a whole run in
one `except`: `DeviceUnreachableError`, `AuthenticationError`,
`NotLoggedInError`, `TokenExpiredError`, `ApiError`, `VesselNotFoundError`,
`EncryptionUnavailableError`, `ExportError`, `StackNotExtendable`,
`ConfirmationRequiredError`, `DeviceBusyError`, `HostNotSetError`.

`StackNotExtendable` is the odd one out: it is never raised at you. It is
how the download says a time stack has to be written whole rather than
extended, and it is always handled internally.

## Layout of this repository

```

  tests/            run with: python -m pytest
```

Nothing lives outside the package any more. The loose `incucyte_downloader.py`
and `incucyte_gui.py` modules are gone, and so is the second `py_incucyte_gui`
package; importing `pyincucyte` registers all three as aliases, so this still
resolves - to the very same module object, so monkeypatching behaves as before:

```python
import pyincucyte
from incucyte_downloader import download_scan_images
```

### Where settings live

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\PyIncucyte`
- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pyincucyte` or `~/.config/pyincucyte`
- Override with `PYINCUCYTE_HOME`

A folder left over from before the rename (`PyIncucyteGUI` / `pyincucytegui`)
keeps being used if it holds settings, and `PYINCUCYTEGUI_HOME` still works, so
upgrading does not log anybody out.

A source checkout that already has a `.tmp/` folder keeps using it.
`PYINCUCYTE_CLIENT_DIR` overrides where the Incucyte client install is looked for.
